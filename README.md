# Industrial-Defect-Segementation-using-Computer-Vision
Simple computer vision project to do instance/semantic segmentation (unfortunately, did not complete...) and trained model is deployed by using Streamlit. Also, I never obtained the best result for this project, it's just a training for me to do image segmentation of computer vision (hehe :D)

## Getting Started

1. Instance segmentation identifies and delineates each object instance in an image, assigning a unique label to each object even if they belong to the same class, making it useful for applications requiring precise object detection and differentiation, such as autonomous driving and medical imaging.

2. Semantic segmentation classifies each pixel in an image into a predefined category, with all objects of the same class assigned the same label, making it ideal for tasks where understanding the overall scene composition is important, like satellite imagery analysis and environmental monitoring.

## Note
I use this repository to keep my learning materials for future reference. If you want to explore the dataset and do some data science analysis thingy, I have uploaded the dataset in Kaggle, where you can also utilize the free GPUs offered by Kaggle to speed up your computation process.
